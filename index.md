  description: Work on the development of GOAT has been ongoing since 2017. The biggest milestone so far was the release of version 1.0 and the founding of  [Plan4Better](https://plan4better.de) as core developer, as well as distributor of the software. Currently, numerous new features are being developed in a co-creative process as part of the 3-year project "GOAT 3.0" (mFUND funding line 2).

  description: GOAT 3.0 will enable, among other things, accessibility analyses for public transport, the car as well as for on-demand transport and intermodal route chains (B+R, P+R). In addition, further indicators, such as a 15-minute city indicator, and analysis options for the planning of green and open spaces will be developed. The integration of additional spatial data sets and smart visualisation will complete the analysis options.
